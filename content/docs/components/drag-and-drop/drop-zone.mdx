## Basic

DropZone's got you covered with mouse, keyboard, and touch support. Just hook up the onDrop prop to manage all the action. Plus, you'll get real-time updates with onDropEnter, onDropMove, and onDropExit events as peeps mess with the dropzone.

## Installation
<InstallCommand isAdd items={['drop-zone']}/>

## Manual Installation

<InstallCommand isInstall isManual items={['react-aria-components']}/>

<SourceCode toShow='drop-zone'/>

## Using FileTrigger
You can use the FileTrigger component to select files from the file system. It's a great way to get a list of files that have been
dragged and dropped into the browser.
