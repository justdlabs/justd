## Basic

A date field lets users type in and tweak date and time values using a keyboard. Each chunk of a date value is shown in its own editable bit.

## Installation

<Install items={['react-aria-components']} />

<SourceCode toShow={['date-field', 'field']} />

## Controlled
When a date field is controlled, it will not be editable by the user. The value must be passed in as a prop.

## Validation
When a date field is validated, it will display a validation message if the value is invalid.
