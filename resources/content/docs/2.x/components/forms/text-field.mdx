## Suffix and Prefix
Enhance your TextField by adding a prefix or suffix. Whether it’s text or icons, it’s flexible to fit your design.

## Suffix with Button
Add a button to the suffix by simply including it in the suffix prop. While you can do the same with a prefix, it’s more common to see it as a suffix.

## Pending
Activate the loading state on your TextField with the `isPending` prop.

## Revealable
When using a text field as a password input, you may want the option to reveal the password. To enable this feature, simply add the `isRevealable` prop. However, ensure that the input type is explicitly set to 'password', as this is a required condition.

In this example, we’ll ensure it’s treated as a strict requirement.
