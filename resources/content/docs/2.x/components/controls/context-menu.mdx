## Basic
This component excels in desktop applications but has significant limitations. Its lack of accessibility and mobile compatibility are notable drawbacks. **React Aria** hasn't released an official version of this component yet, possibly due to these issues.

Unless it's absolutely necessary for your project, I'd advise against using it. For most scenarios requiring accessible, rich interfaces, consider alternatives like [Menus](/docs/components/collections/menu) or [Popovers](/docs/components/overlays/popover) instead. These components typically offer better cross-platform support and accessibility features.

The initial release will be an alpha version due to ongoing issues with cursor positioning accuracy. If you're able to contribute, I'd appreciate your help in submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/justdlabs/justd) to address this component's limitations.
