## Provider and Switcher
First of all, let's create a folder called `providers` inside the `resources/js` directory. Inside this folder, create a file called `theme-provider.tsx`. After that, you of course need a switcher right, so create a file called `theme-switcher.tsx` inside the `Components` folder. So your folder structure now is likes this:
```bash
resources/js
├── Components
│   └── theme-switcher.tsx
│   └── ...
├── providers
│   └── theme-provider.tsx
│   ...
```
<CodeBlock
    source={{
        'providers/theme-provider.tsx': 'dark-mode/vite/theme-provider.tsx',
        'Components/theme-switcher.tsx': 'dark-mode/vite/theme-switcher.tsx',
    }} />

## Usage
Next, you'll use it insdie the `app.tsx` file like this:
<CodeBlock
    source={{
        'app.tsx': 'dark-mode/inertia/app.tsx',
    }} />
