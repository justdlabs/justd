## Introduction
React Aria components such as [Link](/docs/2.x/components/navigation/link), [Menu](/docs/2.x/components/collections/menu), [Tabs](/docs/2.x/components/navigation/tabs), and [Table](/docs/2.x/components/collections/table) transform elements into clickable links that navigate when clicked. These components utilize the `href` prop to render as an `<a>` tag, supporting attributes like `target` and `download`.

User interactions with these links vary by component. For instance, one might use arrow keys to navigate tabs or press enter to open a link within a ComboBox. With the href prop, React Aria facilitates seamless navigation for each component.

Typically, links perform the default browser action when clicked. However, many applications employ client-side routers to prevent full page reloads. The RouterProvider configures React Aria components to integrate with your client-side router. Simply set it up at the root, and any React Aria component with an href will automatically utilize your router.

Note that links to external sites will default to the browser's native navigation, and links not targeting "_self", using the download attribute, or modified with keys like Command or Alt, will also follow the browser's native behavior.

## Router Provider
The `RouterProvider` component accepts two properties: `navigate`. Assign `navigate` to a function from your routing framework that handles client-side navigation. Below are setup examples for various frameworks.
```tsx
import { RouterProvider } from 'react-aria-components';
import { useNavigate } from 'your-router';

export default function Layout() {
  let navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <RouterProvider navigate={navigate}>
      {/* ... */}
    </RouterProvider>
  );
}
```

## Inertia.js
### Global Declaration
To integrate with Inertia.js, you must first declare it in your `.d.ts` file, such as in `global.d.ts`.
<CodeBlock
    source={{
        'types/global.d.ts': 'csr/inertia/global.d.ts',
    }} />


### Providers
Next, you'll need to create a provider for this, but because we're using react aria components, I also show you how to combine your router provider with the theme provider. So we need 3 files:
1. `providers/index.tsx`
2. `providers/theme-provider.tsx`

<CodeBlock
    source={{
        'providers/theme-provider.tsx': 'csr/inertia/theme-provider.tsx',
        'providers/index.tsx': 'csr/inertia/index.tsx',
    }} />
### Usage
After you create the provider files, you can use them in your `app.tsx` file like this:

<CodeBlock
    source={{
        'app.tsx': 'csr/inertia/app.tsx',
    }} />

## Next.js
### Providers
Let's create a providers folder in your root folder, and create two files called `index.tsx` and `theme-provider.tsx` inside it.
<CodeBlock
    source={{
        'providers/theme-provider.tsx': 'dark-mode/nextjs/theme-provider.tsx',
        'providers/index.tsx': 'csr/nextjs/index.tsx',
    }} />
### Usage
After you create the provider files, you can use them in your `app/layout.tsx` file like this:

<CodeBlock
    source={{
        'app/layout.tsx': 'csr/nextjs/layout.tsx',
    }} />


## Remix
For Remix, we can use the `useNavigate` hooks. First, let's create a file `route-provider.tsx` in `app/components` folder.

For comprehensive details, consult the [Remix documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/root).
<CodeBlock
    source={{
        'app/router-provider.tsx': 'csr/remix/router-provider.tsx',
    }} />

### Usage
Then in `app/root.tsx` or your main layout file you can use the `RouteProvider` component to encompass all pages.
<CodeBlock
    source={{
        'app/root.tsx': 'csr/remix/root.tsx',
    }} />

## Tanstack Router
Use these providers if you are using Tanstack Router in your project.
<CodeBlock
    source={{
        'app/index.tsx': 'csr/tanstack/index.tsx',
    }} />

## Others
If you are using a different framework or router provider not mentioned above, refer to the [React Aria Components Docs](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html) for additional information on integrating React Aria components with various routers and frameworks.
