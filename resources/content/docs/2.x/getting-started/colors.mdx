## Change Gray
When you install Justd using the CLI, you'll be prompted to select your preferred gray scale. Options include Tailwind's default grays such as `gray`, `slate`, `zinc`, `stone`, and `neutral`. If needed, you can always visit the [themes](/themes) page to change your selection.
Or by running the following command:
<Installation options={{isExecutor: true}} command='npx justd-cli@latest change-gray' items={['']} />
