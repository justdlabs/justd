## Basic
A basic grid list is an excellent way for users to browse through items, perfect for selecting one or multiple items, and also supports row actions.

## Anatomy
<Anatomy show='grid-list-anatomy'/>

## Multiple Selection
To enable multiple selections, set the `selectionMode` prop to `multiple`. Since this prop has no default value, you must define it explicitly.
<How minW72 toUse="collections/grid-list/grid-list-multiple-demo" />
Note that I haven't set an `id` for the grid list item as the items already have default IDs. However, you should specify the `id` prop for each grid list item like this:
```
{(item) => <GridListItem id={item.name}>{item.name}</GridListItem>}
```

## Drag and Drop
The grid list supports drag and drop functionalities if you use the `dragAndDropHooks` prop along with the `useDragAndDrop` hook. You can drop data on the entire list, individual items, add new items between existing ones, or rearrange items.

## Dragging Between Items
You can move items between positions within the grid list.

## Render Empty State
The grid list can display an empty state when no items are available using the `renderEmptyState` prop.
<How minW72 toUse="collections/grid-list/grid-list-render-empty-state-demo" />

## Controlled
The grid list can be controlled, which means the parent component manages the selection state of each item.
<How minW72 toUse="collections/grid-list/grid-list-controlled-demo" />

## Disabled
Similar to how the [Tag Group](/docs/components/collections/tag-group) component can be disabled using `isDisabled` for children and `disabledKeys` for the parent, the Grid List supports similar functionality. For example, items "Led Zeppelin" and "The Rolling Stones" are disabled.
<How minW72 toUse="collections/grid-list/grid-list-disabled-demo" />

To disable items via the parent component, you can use the `disabledKeys` prop like this:
```tsx {5}
<GridList
  items={items}
  aria-label="Select your favorite bands"
  selectionMode="multiple"
  disabledKeys={[2,5]}
  className="min-w-64"
>
  {(item) => <GridListItem id={item.id}>{item.name}</GridListItem>}
</GridList>
```
