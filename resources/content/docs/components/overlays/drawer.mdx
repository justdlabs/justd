## Basic
A slide-in overlay for extra content or options, anchored to the screen edge for quick access! Originally coded by **Devon Govett**. Check out his [tweet](https://x.com/devongovett/status/1674470185783402496) for more details. Want to improve it, like making the drawer's height adapt to the content? Feel free to drop a [PR](https://github.com/justdlabs/justd).
