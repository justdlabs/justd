## Basic
A sheet is a modal component that slides in from the side of the screen. It's used to display a small amount of content that is related to the main content.

<Composed components={['dialog']} />

## Manual Installation

<InstallCommand isInstall isManual items={['react-aria-components', 'tailwindcss-animate']} />

## Stack
By default, the sheet will stack, but you can change this behavior by using the `isStack` prop. This example demonstrates how to use the `isStack` prop to create a sheet that does not stack.

## Sticky
You can use the `SheetBody` component to make the sheet sticky.

## Header
This setup’s super flexible. If you skip adding `SheetTitle` and just drop a string as its child, it'll auto-render as the title. Like this:
```
<SheetHeader>
  Title
</SheetHeader>
```
Wanna customize more? Throw in props like `title` and `description` for a tailored header:
```
<SheetHeader title='Title' description='Description' />
```

## Custom Styles
To apply custom styles such as background colors or borders to the header, follow this guide:
